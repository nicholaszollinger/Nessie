* Leave everything default when installing.

# How to Build
Double click `GenerateSolution.bat` to generate the Visual Studio Projects and Solution!

`CleanProjectFolder.bat` is used to delete the `.sln` file, and the `Build`, `Intermediate`, `Saved`, `.vs` folders. Basically a convenience
utitlity for me if I have to zip up the project for someone else.
