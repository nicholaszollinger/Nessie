# Nessie
This is a C++20 Game Engine that I am developing to learn and experiment with!

# Compatibility
**Supported Platforms**: *Windows*

**Supported IDEs**: *The build system was made to work with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.*

# How to Build
Double click `GenerateSolution.bat` to generate the Visual Studio Projects and Solution!

`CleanProjectFolder.bat` is used to delete the `.sln` file, and the `Build`, `Intermediate`, `Saved`, `.vs` folders. Basically a convenience
utitlity for me if I have to zip up the project for someone else.
