# This is for managing an assignment project with perforce. Basically, I don't want to have my engine in
# perforce.

# Here you can specify files to ignore when adding files to the depot.
#
# The syntax for P4IGNORE files is not the same as Helix syntax. 
# Instead, it is similar to that used by other versioning systems: 
#
# - Files are specified in local syntax
# - a # character at the beginning of a line denotes a comment
# - a ! character at the beginning of a line excludes the file specification
# - a * wildcard matches substrings.
#
# For example:
# 
# foo.txt    Ignore files called "foo.txt"
# *.exe      Ignore all executables
# !bar.exe   Exclude bar.exe from being ignored
#
#
.p4ignore.txt
*.vcxproj
*.h
*.cpp
*.ixx

# Just ignore everything in this directory.
*.*
